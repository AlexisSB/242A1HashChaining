 - Check default hash table size 3877. DONE - in asgn.c
 - All malloc gets freed. DONE checked with valgrind
 - Convert flexarray to work with strings DONE
 - add search funciton to flexarray called is_present()DONE
 - add visit() function to flexarray DONE
       - visit takes a function as a parxameter and prints each itme in the flexarray similar to RBT preorder function
 - Figure out what visit is supposed to do. DONE

 - Check that getword and emalloc in the mylib.c file and mylib.h header DONE
 - Version control everything including mylib
 - Create a make file for the whole thing.

Red/Black Tree
 - Modify RBT so that duplicate words can be added.
 - Change program so that it checks root is always black.
 -make a preorder print function.

Printing out containers

- each non-empty container should be printed on new line with space between items:
       - <hash index> <item> <item> <item> ...
 - Items for an RBT to be printed in preorder

- make container.h and container.
 - container defined by enum type in container.h
typedef enum container_e {FLEX_ARRAY, RED_BLACK_TREE} container_t;

For main program
 - add different options for command line arguements
 - Use the getopt library for this see page 3.
 - -r
 - -s tablesize
 - -i 
 - write help message to stderr for -h command.
 -

Create container data structure wrapper.
- in container.c
-

 -Code must compile using the command
 gcc -O2 -W -Wall -ansi -pedantic -lm *.c -o asgn
 - put this in the make file to check. Done AB + in Travis CI

Style checks
- No line more than 80 characters
- Comments in function headers
           - description
           - parameters
           - return values
           - special notes
